								<strong>There are millions of poor people in the world. What is our responsibility towards them? Should we help them? How can we help them?</strong>
							</p>
							<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
								Sahay a initiative done by Badlav to help unprivileged people which means COME TOGETHER TO HELP.<br> Badlav Foundation giving a helping hand to a needy one, and it is like act of humanity that we show towards others. We can make a difference in their lives even with a little – it doesn’t demand that much, just a little of what we have and a little of our time. We can change their lives and give them a good will &amp; happiness, by showing them hospitality and love. We can care for what they need and we can give them this even with just a smile and a good deed. Being poor doesn’t make them a different people or unwanted, it’s just a life course that they faced. So I say that we should help everyone, no matter what colour, race or religion they have.
							</p>
							<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
								You know, we have one world that is divided in two. On one side is people living their life in luxury, and on the other side is people who can’t afford to live, they have no place to live, they have no food to eat and they have no clothes to wear. There are poor people who need much more to be able to live, while other people have enough to survive. <br>
								As said, poor people have not enough clothes, food, education and health. To be poor means to
								be deprived economically, politically and socially. They have no possibilities.
								To help poor people is a good job. To care for poor people and to help them is a real task. The
								more you give to poor people, the more you give them strength and if you give them one chance
								or opportunity, you will see a change in your life. <br>
								Another thing is to show the poor people love and respect. It is another way to help poor people.
								Here are five ways to help poor people:
							</p>
							<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
								<ol>
									<li><strong>Give them support:</strong> A good way to help poor people is to give them a hand or a hug.
									Give them moral support, show love, respect and make them aware that someone really
									cares about them.</li>
									<li><strong>Give them economic support:</strong></strong> Ordinary people can help poor people by giving
									economic support. We can help them to solve problem with living. For an example, they
									need to get meals for their family, a place to live or some clothes.</li>
									<li><strong>Give them groceries:</strong> Give groceries to poor people. They can’t even afford a meal for
									themselves or their family. Don’t waste food, it is better to give it to those that need it the
									most.</li>
									<li><strong>Give them old belongings:</strong> To help poor people, is to give them old things, such as old
									clothes, old furniture’s or other old things. Clothes is a big help for poor people especially
									in the winter season.</li>
									<li><strong>Education:</strong> Knowledge can help the poor people to stand on their own feet. To give them
									free education can help them to grow as individuals, help them to live a better life, help
									them to get a job, and to build a career. But it can also help the poor people to develop
									their skills.</li>
								</ol>
